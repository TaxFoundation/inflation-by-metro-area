# Purchasing Power Lost to Inflation in Metro Areas, 2008-2012

Using Bureau of Economic Analysis data, these compiled data shows the change in real purchasing power from 2008 to 2012 at the level of metro and nonmetro areas. The BEA provides data on both the implicit regional price deflator (IRPD) of individual metropolitan areas and the averages for metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties in a state. These two sets are combined. The inverse of the price level for each area is computed to create a parity value in both 2008 and 2012. The difference between them is considered to be the change in purchasing power. The BEA computes IRPDs using regional price parities and the US Personal Consumption Expenditure index. This allows comparison of purchasing power across regions in a given year, across years for a given region, or across regions and years. We elected to display changes in in terms of real dollars-equivalent changes in purchasing power, however, direct percent changes in purchasing power can also be computed, and are similar. The goal of providing these data is to display the differences in effective price changes across various regions within the US. Data for individual metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas are applied uniformly to all counties within those respective areas.
