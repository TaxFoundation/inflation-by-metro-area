# Purchasing Power Lost to Inflation by Metro Area, 2008 to 2012

Using Bureau of Economic Analysis data, this compiled data shows the change in real purchasing power from 2008 to 2012 for metro and nonmetro areas. It uses BEA-produced implicit regional price deflators (IRPDs). IRPDs are calculated by multiplying regional price level indices by the nationwide price index for a given year. This creates a price level estimate that can be compared across regions in a given year, across years for a given region, or across both regions and years. We use IRPDs from 2008 and 2012 to compute the real value (in 2008 dollars) of $100 in each region in each year, giving us the purchasing power of $100. The difference between the 2008 and 2012 purchasing powers is the amount of purchasing power lost due to local area inflation. The goal of providing this data is to display the differences in price changes across various regions within the US. Data for individual metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas are applied uniformly to all counties within those respective areas.
